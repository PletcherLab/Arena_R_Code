## Note, high density and PI plots require ImageMagik to be installed for
## simpler PDF outputs.
## Get it here: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows
## Also required are the following packages: ggplot2, markovchain, Gmisc,
##  data.table, reshape2, readxl, tibble, stringr, readr


rm(list = ls())
## Do one of the following two
